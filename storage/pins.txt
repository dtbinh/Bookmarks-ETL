It is based upon a simple trick that allows you to access Developer options - a secret menu that holds a few very useful options. The menu is a part of the operating system, which means that it can be accessed on every phone and tablet, no matter what version of Android it is running. Thus, whether you own a high-end handset or a cheap Chinese slate, you can speed it up with just a couple of taps. The process is safe for your device and any personal data you store on it, and in case you don't like the final result, you can easily revert the changes and go back to the original setup.1. Open the settings app, scroll all the way down and choose \"About phone\" (or \"About tablet\").2. On the new screen, locate the Build number (it is usually the last item on the list) and repeatedly tap on it.3. After a few seconds you will see a message that reads \"You are now a developer!\". Now, the Developer options menu will be added to the settings app.4. Tap on it and you'll see a list of items detailing various settings on your device. If you're not a developer, they will be of no use to you, so scroll down the list until you find the following three settings: Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator animation scale.5. Tap each of them to change their value. It is \"1x\" by default and if you want to give your device a dramatical boost of speed, change it to \"0.5x\". That is it! All window and transition animations will be shorter by 50 percent, which will result in noticeably faster performance. If you want, you can completely turn them off, this may make your device feel even snappier because then there are no animations that need to be carried out - but you do end up missing out on the smooth UI experience.If you recommend any other great Android tips and tricks, be sure to leave them in the comments below and we may feature them on the site.","name":"Speed Up Your Android Device With This Simple Trick","authors":[{"name":"Jaroslaw"}]},"link":{"locale":"en","title":"Speed Up Your Android Device With This Simple Trick","site_name":"UltraLinx","description":"If you feel your Android smartphone or tablet could use a boost, this trick may be worth your while.

Recent successes in AI have shown that machines can now perform at human levels in many tasks that, just a few years ago, were considered to be decades away, like driving cars, understanding spoken language, and recognizing objects. But these are all tasks where we know what needs to be done, and the machine is just imitating us. What about tasks where the right answers are not known? Can machines be programmed to find solutions on their own, and perhaps even come up with creative solutions that humans would find difficult? The answer is a definite yes! There are branches of AI focused precisely on this challenge, including evolutionary computation and reinforcement learning. Like the popular deep learning methods, which are responsible for many of the recent AI successes, these branches of AI have benefitted from the million-fold increase in computing power we’ve seen over the last two decades. There arenow antennas in spacecraft so complex they could only be designed through computational evolution. There are game playing agents in Othello, Backgammon, and most recently in Go that have learned to play at the level of the best humans, and in the case of AlphaGo, even beyond the ability of the best humans. There are non-player characters in Unreal Tournament that have evolved to be indistinguishable from humans, thereby passing the Turing test— at least for game bots. And in finance, there are computational traders in thestock market evolved to make real money. These AI agents are different from those commonly seen in robotics, vision, and speech processing in that they were not taught to perform specific actions. Instead, they learned the best behaviors on their own by exploring possible behaviors and determining which ones lead to the best outcomes. Many such methods are modeled after similar adaptation in biology. For instance, evolutionary computation takes concepts from biological evolution. The idea is to encode candidate solutions (such as videogame players) in such a way that it is possible to recombine and mutate them to get new solutions. Then, given a large population of candidates with enough variation, a parallel search method is run to find a candidate that actually solves the problem. The most promising candidates are selected for mutation and recombination in order to construct even better candidates as offspring. In this manner, only an extremely tiny fraction of the entire group of possible candidates needs to be searched to find one that actually solves the problem, e.g. plays the game really well. We can apply the same approach to many domains where it is possible to evaluate the quality of candidates computationally. It applies to many design domains, including the design of the space antenna mentioned above, the design of a control system for a finless rocket, or the design of a multilegged, walking robot. Often evolution comes up with solutions that are truly unexpected but still effective — in other words, creative. For instance, when working on a controller that would navigate a robotic arm around obstacles, we accidentally disabled its main motor. It could no longer reach targets far away, because it could not turn around its vertical axis. What the controller evolved to do instead was slowly turn the arm away from the target, using its remaining motors, and then swing it back really hard, turning the whole robot towards the target through inertia!

The first was the Garduino, an arduino controlled garden to help you grow plants at home. The second was the Tweet-a-Watt, a project that teaches you how to monitor your home power usage using Xbees and Twitter. I read about both these projects here at Instructables and in Make Magazine, Vol 18. I thought it would be great to combine both these projects and build myself an indoor garden that I could monitor from work via Twitter. Thus began an adventure in gardening and electronics that taught me a lot and took me much longer than perhaps it should have.

missing teeth with new bioengineered teeth, grown from stem cells generated from a person's own gum cells, is a new method that will be vastly superior to the currently used implant technology. New research, published in the Journal of Dental Research and led by Professor Paul Sharpe, an expert in craniofacial development and stem cell biology at King's College London's Dental Institute, describes advances in the development of this method by sourcing the required cells from a patient's own gum. Research towards producing bioengineered teeth, also called bioteeth, aims to grow new and natural teeth by employing stem cell technology which generates immature teeth (teeth primordia) that mimic those in the embryo. These can be transplanted as small cell pellets into the adult jaw to develop into functional teeth, the researchers say. Remarkably, despite the very different environments, embryonic teeth primordia can develop normally in the adult mouth. Embryonic tooth primordia cells can readily form immature teeth following dissociation into single cell populations and subsequent recombination, but such cell sources are impractical to use in a general therapy. \"What is required is the identification of adult sources of human epithelialand mesenchymal [stem] cells that can be obtained in sufficient numbers to make biotooth formation a viable alternative to dental implants,\" said Sharpe. This challenge was now solved by the researchers, who sucessfully isolated adult human gum (gingival) tissue from patients at the Dental Institute at King's College London, grew more of it in the lab, and then combined it with the cells of mice that form teeth (mesenchyme cells). By transplanting this combination of cells into mice, the researchers were able to grow hybrid human/mouse teeth containing dentine and enamel, as well as viable roots. \"Epithelial cells derived from adult human gum tissue are capable of responding to tooth inducing signals from embryonic tooth mesenchyme in an appropriate way to contribute to tooth crown and root formation and give rise to relevant differentiated cell types, following in vitro culture,\" said Sharpe. \"These easily accessible epithelial cells are thus a realistic source for consideration in human biotooth formation. The next major challenge is to identify a way to culture adult human mesenchymal cells to be tooth-inducing, as at the moment we can only make embryonic mesenchymal cells do this.\" Current implant-based methods of whole tooth replacement fail to reproduce a natural root structure and as a consequence of the friction from eating and other jaw movement, loss of jaw bone can occur around the implant.","name":"Bioteeth From Stemcells Will Regrow Complete Tooth, Superior to Implants","authors":[]},"link":{"locale":"en","title":"Bioteeth From Stemcells Will Regrow Complete Tooth, Superior to Implants | Amazing Science","site_name":"Scoop.it","description":"Replacing missing teeth with new bioengineered teeth, grown from stem cells generated from a person's own gum cells, is a new method that will be vastly superior to the currently used implant technology.New research, published in the Journal of Dental Research and led by Professor Paul Sharpe, an expert in craniofacial development and stem cell biology at King's College London's Dental Institute, describes advances in the development of this method by sourcing the required cells from a patient's own gum.Research towards producing bioengineered teeth, also called bioteeth, aims to grow new and natural teeth by employing stem cell technology which generates immature teeth (teeth primordia) that mimic those in the embryo.

The team here in conjunction with the community members and contributors on the forums have put together an amazing tool that builds on all the successes of the 2.7. Firstly, we focused on improving the build process to make it more enjoyable and straightforward. It's faster and easier but doesn't take out any of the fun stuff. We've added more ways to hack, build, and explore with your own OpenROV such as being able to wire directly to additional servo and PWM channels. It's never been easier to hack or modify an underwater robot. Second, the 2.8 is reliable and rugged in the field. We've increased the thickness of the main acrylic tube so it can now stream live HD video to your laptop from a maximum recommended depth of 100m. A redesign of the endcaps leads to less leaks and o-ring failures while allowing for quick battery changes when your hands are wet, dirty, and/or cold. A broader and more balanced chassis will keep the OpenROV stable in more turbulent conditions. Optimizations across all aspects of the version 2.8 has further increased the weight budget for add-ons and modifications to 6oz. (170g) without the need for flotation. Ultimately, we hope that the OpenROV 2.8 is the DIY underwater ROV of your dreams. We're very, very eager to follow what you see and do with it on the forums and OpenExplorer!   Build!    You don't need to be an expert to build your own underwater robot. OpenROV 2.8 has easy, step-by-step instructions. Each skill is introduced so that you can learn the basics of soldering, assembly, and potting electronics. Our amazing and knowledgeable technical support team is there to back you up every step of the way.       Hack!    Set your imagination free with community built add-ons and creations of your own design! In the true spirit of Open-Souce hardware, the technical forums are full of vibrant, helpful, and enthusiastic builders, makers, and coders. Once built, you will have a window into a new world of possibilities with endless variation and potential. For example: external lights for filming at night, grabber arm for deep-sea recovery, sampling device for catching plankton.            Explore!          Small, light, and capable, you can take OpenROV 2.8 with you anywhere. Onboard lights, camera, and lasers can help you discover things in places you can't or shouldn't go yourself, up to 100m deep! OpenROV also connects you the amazing, supportive community of people on OpenExplorer who are collaborating with other OpenROV pilots, institutions, and individuals around the world in the name of science, adventure or plain curiosity about what's down there.        For more information, please check out the product page.  ","favicon":"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/favicons/88597be6effbe4ab390470517faa80c515da016b4b9a8169a1615125.png?c7f7681bcb67cd394e50fc7cbcc83351"}}},{"Id":"19984792076217452","Url":"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/19984792076217452/","created_at":"2016-09-08T10:01:16","Note":"DIY Underwater ROV (Submarine)","Board":{"Id":"19984860785669270","Url":"https://www.pinterest.com/alansamet/diy-rov/","Name":"diy ROV"},"Counts":{"Repins":0,"Likes":0,"Comments":0},"image":{"Original":{"Url":"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/31/c2/cf/31c2cf2f0f18afcdff2fb7d4f8b3818b.jpg","Width":620,"Height":413}},"Link":"https://www.pinterest.com/r/pin/19984792076217452/4779055074072594921/3752db12108e09cad42106e208ef41c085bd8af61c5df7d36550c087e2d82394","original_link":"http://m.instructables.com/id/How-to-build-a-ROV-Submarine/","Color":"#725838","Media":{"type":"image"},"Attribution":null,"Metadata":{"article":{"published_at":"2013-06-29T00:00:00","description":"A while back I was looking around on the internet and saw someone's home built ROV.

Being able to follow the sun's path through the sky can raise your solar panel system's output considerably (30-50%), but the argon filled ones can be a bit pricey, and seem to be a bit unsteady in wind. I looked at several different designs, looked at what materials I could find, and this is how I did it. The panel is mounted to a frame, which is attached to two bike wheels. The wheels are mounted to a larger wooden frame, and the wheels and panel are moved by a 12 volt linear actuator. The sensor is an LED model and is purchased from Redrok Energy.The LED sensor senses the path of the sun and tells the actuator how much to move to keep the panel properly oriented. ...","name":"Finishing it up","authors":[]},"link":{"locale":"en","title":"Finishing it up","site_name":"Instructables.com","description":"This is pretty much the finished product, and it works well.
